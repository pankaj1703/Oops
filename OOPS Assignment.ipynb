    "        1) Encapsulation in object oriented programming\n",
    "Encapsulation is a principle that seeks to hide the implementation details of objects from the outside world. It states that all important information is contained within the object; only selected data is available externally. Each object's inner workings and state are stored privately within the specified class, whereas other objects do not have access to it or the ability to make changes. Instead, they can only interact with a few public functions or methods. This form of data hiding provides program security and control over object state changes, reduces the risk of errors, and makes the program more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Inheritance in object oriented programming\n",
    "Inheritance is a principle that enables developers to create new classes based on existing (parent) classes, with the option of overriding or augmenting their properties and methods. This is especially useful in programs containing thousands of lines of code, as it simplifies maintenance and prevents code duplication. By using the logic of the parent class in the child class, developers can create objects that share code or logic yet are different. This reduces the complexity of the code and eliminates the need to create a new object for each object used in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Polymorphism in object oriented programming\n",
    "Polymorphism is a principle that complements inheritance by allowing objects of different classes to perform actions with the same name using different code. For instance, the \"show information\" method can be used to display varied data about objects of the \"car\", \"plane\", or \"ship\" type. Furthermore, polymorphism helps to create more flexible and modular programs. Generally, it simplifies the development process as it allows for the creation of common methods and functions to be used for multiple types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Abstraction in object oriented programming\n",
    "Abstraction helps you focus on a system's essential elements and ignore the less important details that have no effect on its key features. It allows you to construct more understandable programs. Abstraction can be thought of as an expansion of encapsulation. Take programs that contain thousands of lines of code as an example. Through the principle of abstraction, each object only reveals a specific mechanism for usage. Therefore, the code inside becomes largely independent of other objects. For instance, in a program that stores information about movies, you can create a class \"Movie\" that provides access to only the most essential details, such as title, release year, and genre, while hiding the less important information, like shots or technical aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Association in object orinted programming\n",
    "Association represents a relationship between two or more objects. It can be a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship. Associations are typically established through instance variables or method parameters. "

    "Answer:- Class Method\n",
    "        Class methods are associated with the class rather than instances. They are defined using the @classmethod decorator and take the class itself as the first parameter, usually named cls. Class methods are useful for tasks that involve the class rather than the instance, such as creating class-specific behaviors or modifying class-level attributes.\n",
    "    Example:- the MyClass defines a class variable class_variable, and the class_method is a class method that increments this variable. When calling the method with different values, it updates and returns the modified class variable. Instances obj1 and obj2 have their own instance_variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Instance Method\n",
    "    Instance methods are the most common type of methods in Python classes. They are associated with instances of a class and operate on the instance's data. When defining an instance method, the method's first parameter is typically named self, which refers to the instance calling the method. This allows the method to access and manipulate the instance's attributes.\n",
    "  Example:- the Person class defines an instance method introduce which returns a formatted introduction based on the instance's name and age attributes. The instance person1 is created with the name \"Kishan\" and age 20, and invoking the introduce method prints a personalized introduction for that instance. Note that there's a small typo in the comment mentioning the age; it should be 20 instead of 30."

    "Method Resolution Order(MRO) it denotes the way a programming language resolves a method or attribute. Python supports classes inheriting from other classes. The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass. In python, method resolution order defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method. First, the method or attribute is searched within a class and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting. This order is also called Linearization of a class and set of rules are called MRO(Method Resolution Order). While inheriting from another class, the interpreter needs a way to resolve the methods that are being called via an instance. Thus we need the method resolution order."
